# Password-Encryptor-and-Decryptor

This is an object-oriented C++ project that encrypts and decrypts user data. Note that no database program is used! It implements its own database 
querys through file read/writes! (Note: It is currently limited to 7 entries Facebook, Gamil... the major apps used, it can be easily expanded into more data in the future!)

It particularly deals with storing account password and usernames. 
It has a smooth user interface; allowing for a a very fast & low level application for storing important data!
